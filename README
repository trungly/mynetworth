Mint.com is a personal finance website that sends out an email of your financial summary every Friday.  Included in that email is a "Net Worth" number.  If you do a good job of inputting all your data into Mint, this is a fairly accurate gauge of your net worth.

I wanted to automatically generate a nice graph of my net worth, so that's what this script does.  This is not a webapp, just a ruby script.

This script is really only meant for me, but if for some strange reason you want to try it, this is what you'll need:
1) Have Mint send the statements to a Gmail account
2) Set up a filter to label all those emails as "MintStatements"
3) Ruby (duh!) with scruffy and builder gems installed

Usage: ruby graph_networth.sh <your_gmail_username> <your_gmail_password>

Output: mynetworth.svg

Known issues: There was some error with scruffy and builder on Ruby 1.9.1.  1.8.7 works fine.
